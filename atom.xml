    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning to program at a code school is a great opportunity to acquire new skills, and to make your current skills relevant in tech. Becoming a software developer is the most common goal, but there is a wide variety of roles that technical people can play in software that aren&rsquo;t about writing code. Whether you have left a job in customer service, teaching, or research, the skills you gained in your last career will help you fill a niche in your new one. Here are a few paths in tech that don&rsquo;t involve writing software, but do require some experience with coding, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Product Manager</h3>

<h5>Code School + Business Management</h5>

<p>As a product manager (aka product owner), you decide what features to build by studying the market and learning your customers&#8217; needs. The result of your research is a product road map and business strategy for the next year and beyond. Field experience is essential to making good business decisions.</p>

<h3>Project Manager</h3>

<h5>Code School + Project Management</h5>

<p>A project manager follows the product road map feature by feature. In this role you will be responsible for marshalling resources and delivering product. Excellent communication skills are a must, as is a technical familiarity with the system under construction. You need to ask the right questions, identify risks, validate estimates, and eliminate blockers.</p>

<h3>Engineering Manager</h3>

<h5>Code School + Project Management + People Management</h5>

<p>High-functioning teams do not manifest by chance &mdash; they are the result of deliberate choices made at the intersection of project needs, culture fit, and career growth. As an engineering manager, you don&rsquo;t just assemble the team. You also schedule projects, implement (or remove) processes, grow careers, and communicate up and down the management chain. In addition to all of these tasks, you must be familiar with the job the team is performing.</p>

<h3>Technical Writer</h3>

<h5>Code School + Written Communication Skills</h5>

<p>Writing technical specs and documentation will require all of your technical knowledge as well as language, teaching, and research skills. The technical writing field is expected to grow enormously in the next 10 years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and delivering web-based product support will be par for the course. Use your new coding skills to build documentation websites and forums, as well as generate useful content.</p>

<h3>Technical Support</h3>

<h5>Code School + Customer Service</h5>

<p>Technical support is growing at a similar pace to technical writing. Helping users interact successfully with a product is essential to their happiness, and companies have a vested interest in troubleshooting where these interactions go wrong. You act as liaison between the end user and the development and management teams by reporting and triaging bugs, working with developers to resolve issues, and communicating with internal customers as well as external ones.</p>

<h3>Quality Assurance Engineer</h3>

<h5>Code School + Product Knowledge</h5>

<p>As a QA engineer, you are a product expert, not a tester. You understand the way users interact with the product and how the features interact with each other. You can reveal blind spots in design and edge cases of user experience that will catch a feature engineer unawares. Combining attention to detail with a holistic view of the system, QA engineers ensure that users continue to trust the product you are delivering.</p>

<p>Not everyone leaves code school with a passion for building software, but everyone does leave with the skills they need to have an awesome career in tech. No education or experience is wasted, so don&rsquo;t forget to leverage your current skill set as you are learning a new one.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/get-your-foot-in-the-door</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many people have asked me what it is like on the other side of code school, and if there is any advice I would give to someone before they get their first programming job. Technical ability, problem solving, and communication skills are all essential to success as a developer, and your online presence is a way to demonstrate all three. Getting your foot in the door requires having something to show &mdash; keeping your foot in the door requires a little bit more.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Have something to show</h3>

<p>Not every developer spends every waking moment working on open source projects or inventing the next big framework. We all have lives, families, and other pursuits that take priority; <img class="left" src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/150412-getting-a-job/Octocat.png" width="300" title="Octocat from www.github.com" >however, experienced programmers likely have solid work-related contributions they can point to during an interview. First-timers need some proof that they can apply what they learn. Side projects show potential employers what you are learning, and that you are interested in programming, not just the salary it comes along with.</p>

<p>Create a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. If you are in code school, you are likely already working towards a portfolio of apps and widgets to show off during an interview. If you are considering code school, this is something you should not wait to do. When you work through a tutorial, commit it to GitHub, give it a README, and include what you are working through and why.</p>

<h3>Start filling your toolbox</h3>

<p>You can usually assemble a piece of Ikea furniture with only an allen key, but what about that desk drawer that suddenly calls for a screwdriver? Completing the task requires the right tools for the job, and your ability to solve a programming problem is no different. Git, Chrome Developer Tools, and Pry are part of the the Swiss Army knife for any web developer.
<img class="right" src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/150412-getting-a-job/toolbox.jpg" width="300" title="Fill your toolbox." ></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://git-scm.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a> is like &ldquo;track changes&rdquo; for source code. The docs describe it as a series of snapshots of your code base. &ldquo;Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to <a href="" title="[Getting started with git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)">it</a>.&rdquo; Source control allows you to work in the same code base with other developers and not step on one another&rsquo;s toes. Start with <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">Git Immersion</a> for some practical experience.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools"><strong>Chrome Developer Tools</strong></a> give you access to everything that happens to your application when it is sent to the browser. Troubleshoot Javascript, CSS, and layout issues without having to refresh the page. Check out the tutorials at <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/">discover-devtools</a> by CodeSchool.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/pry/pry"><strong>Pry</strong></a> gives you an interactive debugging session wherever you put a breakpoint in a Rails application. <code>binding.pry</code> throws you down the rabbit hole into the inner workings of your program&rsquo;s psyche. Check out <a href="http://katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/exploring-the-stack/">exploring the stack</a> for more details about this powerful tool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the docs</strong>. Knowing how to find and navigate documentation is more important than remembering how to do File I/O. If you find yourself in a technical interview where they don&rsquo;t let you search the web for help, share your thought process, imagine the solution you might have found had you performed the search, and work your way through the problem with pseudocode. Experienced developers use Google search and StackOverflow constantly, so pop that error message into the search bar to see what turns up. A word to the wise: if an answer was posted more than two years ago, it may no longer be relevant.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Get to know your community</h3>

<p>Your next job in programming is more likely to come from someone in your network than from hitting the street with your resume. If you can claim an acquaintance with someone from a company you want to work for, that is one more point in your favour.</p>

<p>Go to meetups. If you are shy about meeting lots of new people at once, try introducing yourself to the invited speakers at the end &mdash; they are usually well connected and respected in the community. If you approach them with your name and a question or comment about their talk, they are likely to remember you.</p>

<h3>Do scary things</h3>

<p>Not like skydiving, or alligator wrestling. Write blogs, contribute to open source projects, start <a href="http://createyourproglang.com/">your own programming language</a>, or become visible on social media. You don&rsquo;t need to be an expert to have an opinion. Don&rsquo;t stop taking risks after you land your first job, either.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><img class="left" src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/150412-getting-a-job/against-the-grain.jpg" width="300" title="Do something risky." >Find an area of your work that people are avoiding and become an expert. You will be known as the person who can do that thing we all hate, and your colleagues will value your expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the hardest ticket from the top of the stack. Don&rsquo;t sift through them until you find something you think you know how to do. Your best opportunity to stretch your skills is to do something scary and uncomfortable.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I work with a lot of people who don&rsquo;t have formal computer science degrees, and while their backgrounds vary, they all share a love of problem solving and a willingness to work hard. Take responsibility for your own learning &mdash; code school will only bring you so far, and the rest is up to you.</p>

    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/what-is-it-like-to-be-a-programmer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My manager has invited me to help her give a talk to students in a Web Development program. I have been working in the field for about 18 months, and a lot of the uncertainty is still fresh in my mind: what is it like to be a programmer? How can I get a job as a junior? What can I do now that will help me in my first job? I didn&rsquo;t know many people in the industry, and was unaware of the vast meetup community<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Answers to these questions were difficult to find online, so over the next few posts I will make an attempt.</p>

<h3>Meetings: Important communication tools.</h3>

<p>Programming is mostly about decision making, and not all decisions can be made alone. Questions like, what technologies to use, how you should spend your time, and how to scale, require meetings with managers and other teams.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sprint planning</strong> is a weekly meeting where the team gets together with managers to prioritize tasks for the week. You look back on last week, and either carry over tasks you didn&rsquo;t accomplish, or re-prioritize based on what has arisen in the meantime.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standups</strong> happen daily, and should only last around 10 minutes. You each take a turn sharing what you worked on yesterday, what you are working on today, and whether you are blocked by anything. It is important to speak up when you are stuck! Sharing your blockers will usually result in help; someone may have encountered this problem before, have a new approach to suggest, or have insider information that can get you to a solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demos</strong> will happen on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and are an opportunity to share your accomplishments. While many stakeholders are involved in the project and sprint planning, they are often disconnected from the work as it is being performed. Regular demos help to keep them in the loop, and are an opportunity to explain both progress and unexpected delays.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code reviews</strong> can be formal or informal, and allow your team to gain consensus on style, design, performance, and testing. Your code design decisions will have an impact on the project as a whole, so it never hurts to get feedback from a teammate before you ship it. Readability is more important than cleverness, and is a kindness to future maintainers.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>A portion of your week will always be spent in meetings. Try to identify when your most productive hours are in the day, and keep that time free. For example, if you lump meetings around lunch (none before 11am or after 2pm) you have a solid chunk of time in the morning and the afternoon to focus effectively.</p>

<h3>Stories: How big ideas are turned into actions.</h3>

<p>An idea like &ldquo;improve the user&rsquo;s experience of widget B&rdquo; is a goal, not a task. It can be broken down into <strong>stories</strong> such as: <em>identify the problem</em>, <em>brainstorm solutions</em>, <em>design the new widget</em>, and <em>implement the new widget</em>. Each of these stories are actionable: there is a clear path from start to finish. Use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single-responsibility principle</a> in your stories as well as in your code: if you use the word AND to describe the task, that is a hint that you should have two stories instead of one. Most companies will use a task management, or <strong>ticket</strong> system such as Pivotal Tracker or Jira, where you can see what work is assigned to you, and where managers can check in on your progress.</p>

<h3>Feature Work: What should be built?</h3>

<p>Product managers have their eye on the market. They know what features our customers want, and they know what our competitors offer. A product manager will build a product road-map with a long schedule (think months and years, not weeks). The team will sit down with the feature requirements and a first-draft design, break it down into stories, and estimate the time/complexity of each story. Managers then apportion those estimates into chunks of work &mdash; in <strong>Agile</strong>, these chunks are laid out in <strong>sprints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></strong>.</p>

<p>Defining work in this way lets you identify what can be done in parallel and what needs to be in place before the next task can be accomplished. It also gives project managers the information they need to make decisions about what to sacrifice in order to meet a deadline. If the project is over the time budget, and gold-plated widget A needs features 1, 2, and 3, then maybe you can ship the widget with only 1 and 2, but save 3 for later. Sometimes you have to compromise on feature completeness just to get it out the door.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting and Maintenance: Detective work.</h3>

<p>Finding a bug is like being a detective: you gather clues, follow leads, and occasionally end up lost in a blind alley. A single line of code can hold multiple bugs (Pro tip: watch out for Regexes<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> &mdash; they are a great place for bugs to hide). In a code base with hundreds of thousands of lines, you will inevitably spend more time hunting and fixing bugs than writing new code.</p>

<h3>Deploying code: Sending it into the wild.</h3>

<p>Running an application in production is not the same as running it on your computer. Your application may need to serve thousands of requests per second, and a single instance running on a single server won&rsquo;t cut it. There is a whole stack of management software that you would do well to be familiar with, and having at least a passing familiarity with <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>, and <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html">bash scripting</a> will help you when it is your turn to carry the pager.</p>

<h3>Pager duty: Evil alarm clock.</h3>

<p>When you write software that your customers use around the clock, you have to be there when things break, no matter what time. Most companies will institute a rotation to share the burden of vigilence around the team. Having great documentation about what to do in an emergency is essential to finding a clear path of action at 3am. As with anything, the more you prepare, the higher your confidence level will be.</p>

<p>The job is far from routine because of the diverse set of problems to solve. I have become comfortable grabbing a story without already knowing the answer, partly from knowing that if I get stuck I am no more than a &ldquo;Hey Bryan,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey KWu,&rdquo; away from someone who wants to help, even if it is at 3am (thanks again, Vince!).</p>

    <link href="http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/exploring-the-stack/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/exploring-the-stack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another brilliant Rails troubleshooting technique I have recently added to my toolbox is <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry-stack_explorer"><code>pry-stack_explorer</code></a> as an add-on to <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry"><code>pry</code></a>.</p>

<h4>1. Add <code>pry</code> and <code>pry-stack_explorer</code> to the development/test group of your gemfile:</h4>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:test</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:development</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;pry&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;pry-stack_explorer&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>2. Add a binding pry anywhere in your code</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/150325-show-stack/binding-pry.png"></p>

<h4>3. Enter <code>show-stack</code> at the pry prompt</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/150325-show-stack/show-stack.png"></p>

<h4>4. Enter <code>up</code> or <code>down</code> to explore the state of the stack</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/150325-show-stack/travel-the-stack.png"></p>

<h4>Other goodies</h4>

<ul>
<li>Pass a string to <code>up</code> or <code>down</code> and <code>pry-stack_explorer</code> will jump to the first frame that matches:</li>

    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/troubleshooting-nested-scopes-in-angular</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many beginner Angular tutorials start with a set of canned data, an input field, and a search filter, so it was a natural place to start on my side project, Virtual Playbill. With even a small data set, watching the DOM change based on search criteria was a thrilling achievement. In the intervening months, as features were added, rebuilt, or taken away, I had inadvertently broken the search box. The tutorials were still available, and still fairly basic, but I couldn&rsquo;t get it to work. Not until I found a couple of invaluable tools for troubleshooting overlapping scopes: <!--more--></p>

<h4>1. Use the developer tools console</h4>

<p>This handy trick will give you a console object corresponding to that element&rsquo;s scope:</p>

<ul>
<li>select a DOM element in using the chrome developer tools</li>
<li>enter <code>angular.element($0).scope()</code> into the console pane (<code>$0</code> is a global variable holding a reference to the selected DOM element)</li>
</ul>

<p>Things are definitely looking different between the scope containing my search box and the scope where I am laying out the view: the second scope appears to be a sibling of the first. I needed something a little more visual before it completely sunk in, though.</p>

<h4>2. Use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ng-inspector-for-angularj/aadgmnobpdmgmigaicncghmmoeflnamj">ng-inspector</a></h4>

<p>ng-inpector is a browser extension that allows you to navigate your angular app as if it were a file directory:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/vp_ng_inspector.png"></p>

<p>I can see at a glance that the scope containing the search box (#2), is separate from the scope where I am laying out my view (the unnamed scope #5).</p>

<p>Because of these tools, I have learned that multiple instances of the same controller do not share scope. Using ng-router, I declared the controller for the view:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app.js </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>  <span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">when</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">templateUrl</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;views/index.html&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">controller</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;PlaybillController&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In my layout, I had declared the controller once more:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>layout.html </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">ng-controller=</span><span class="s">&quot;PlaybillController&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-group&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-control&quot;</span> <span class="na">placeholder=</span><span class="s">&quot;Search shows&quot;</span> <span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">&quot;search.title&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The search box was already in the context of a Playbill Controller, and I had inadvertently put in another. The solution was to simply remove the second ng-controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>layout.html </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>  ...

Almost every day I learn another 1-inch picture frame of programming, and writing it down helps me understand it better.

I have a node/angular/mongo stack running on Heroku, and want to use Amazon to store images. I was delighted to stumble across <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3-upload-node"><em>Direct to S3 Uploads in Node.js</em></a>, written by Will Webberly for the Heroku Dev Center blog.
Following his <a href="https://github.com/flyingsparx/NodeDirectUploader">example</a>, I was able to upload images directly from the browser to S3, saving my app server a whole lot of work.</p>

<p>In the example, when a user selects a file for upload, the browser asks the node server for a temporary signed request. The server replies with a signed url, and the browser can send the data directly to Amazon. TADA &mdash; Almost. With a few exceptions. One of the prerequisites is that you know how to set up an S3 bucket and IAM user with the correct access controls.</p>

<h4>Setting the S3 stage</h4>

<p>When S3 receives a request it must verify that the requester has the proper permissions &mdash; both at the account level, as well as at the bucket level. With a seemingly infinite number of services available through Amazon, I found that I had to aggregate information from a few different sources.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a bucket

<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html">this Amazon tutorial</a> for how to create a bucket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a user

<ul>
<li>See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_SettingUpUser.html#Using_CreateUser_console">this Amazon tutorial</a> for creating an IAM User.</li>
<li>Be sure to record the generated <code>Access Key ID</code> and <code>Secret Access Key</code>. They will act as user name and password for accessing your bucket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grant the IAM User access to S3

<ul>
<li>In the IAM User section of the AWS Management Console, select <code>Attach Policy</code>, and add <code>AmazonS3FullAccess</code> from the list
<img src="http://www.katieleonard.ca/images/IAM_Management_Console.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grant the IAM User access to the bucket

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="http://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html">this Amazon tool</a> to help you generate an Access Control Policy. The key pieces you need for the policy generator are the AWS Principle (the user you created), which you enter in the format <code>arn:aws:iam::&lt;your_account_number&gt;:&lt;IAM_user_name&gt;</code>, and the Resource (the bucket you created), which you enter in the format <code>arn:aws:s3:::&lt;your_bucket_name&gt;/*</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Angular client side</h4>

<p>Using an angular app on the client side is also a slight deviation from the Webberly tutorial. Angular <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1375">does not support</a> an <code>ng-change</code> binding on file input elements, but there is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17923521">workaround</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;file&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-control btn&quot;</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;image&quot;</span> <span class="na">onchange=</span><span class="s">&quot;angular.element(this).scope().s3Upload(this)&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Additionally, instead of adding the upload function as plain javascript in your html template, add the <code>s3Upload</code> function onto the <code>$scope</code> in your controller.</p>

<h4>Add <code>image</code> to your schema</h4>

<p>The last stumbling block I encountered was saving the image url into mongo. The image would upload and appear just fine, but wouldn&rsquo;t persist the url as a property of the object. I had forgotten to add the image to my mongo Schema &mdash; the schema acts a bit like a whitelist for saving attributes through mongoose into mongo. Adding the <a href="https://github.com/keighty/virtualplaybill2/blob/ad04bcde8ce00c5ce349f43d2e0cc50549c59df7/models/posts_model.js#L11">imageUrl to the schema</a> solved all my woes.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/everybody-writes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Everybody Writes</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Ann Handley teaches content marketers how to generate &ldquo;ridiculously good&rdquo; content. Anyone who has recently enjoyed the pain of the job hunt will notice that much of the advice can be adapted to self-marketing. In my recent code school experience, developing an online presence was as important as learning web development, and since it is hard to market yourself as a web developer without developing anything for the web, a blog is a great place to start. You have picked a career where your ability to learn is one of your most marketable skills, as well as your ability to communicate &mdash; both of which you can showcase in your blog. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about having something original to say: treat it as an opportunity to organize your thoughts and to teach a beginner what you know. Handley gives great advice for people learning to blog and how to generally optimize your online presence &mdash; both are great ways to market yourself as a fresh code-school alum.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Show up</h3>

<p>Write early, write often. If something is new to you, it will likely be new to someone else as well. The more writing practice you get, the easier it becomes &mdash; &ldquo;writing is a habit, not an art&rdquo;, and you can&rsquo;t help but improve in an art that you practice every day. Handley recommends starting with the ugly first draft<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> &mdash; make it ugly, don&rsquo;t delete anything, don&rsquo;t rephrase or reread. Just get it out of you and on to your screen, then walk away for a day. Maybe two. If you are really stuck on how to begin, you could start with &ldquo;Dear diary&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This helps you get in the mood to write, and keeps your tone conversational. Also, if you are writing to a non-technical person, it will keep your writing clear, and inspire you to give enough back story so that they aren&rsquo;t lost.</p>

<h3>Write a tight post</h3>

<h4>Decide on a goal</h4>

<p>Is it to teach? To share? To critique? The goal for technical blogs is not usually to obtain a following &mdash; it is to share a bit of experience that will turn up when another frustrated developer puts keywords into a search engine. An online presence is important, but it should not be a blow by blow of how hard it is to learn to code. A handy formula for creating quality content is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Utility * Inspiration * Empathy = Quality Content<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Make it useful, make it reader centric (even if that reader is you six months from now), and make it thoughtful.</p>

<h4>Forget the 5 paragraph essay format from high school</h4>

<p>I rarely read a long blog post from beginning to end, and the sweet spot for length is around 1500 words<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. Make it easy for the reader to get the gist of your post by providing sub-headings, bold text, and code samples &mdash; these are strong visual elements that can help your reader anchor what they are learning.</p>

<h4>Rewrite</h4>

<p>Once you have written the ugly first draft with your goal in mind, rewrite it with the reader in mind &mdash; will they understand the context of what you are trying to get across? Assume the reader knows nothing, but isn’t stupid. Find data and examples that illustrate what you are trying to share (and make sure that you give credit where credit is due<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>).</p>

<h4>Work on your grammar</h4>

<p>After reframing, examine your sentence structure. Are you using a passive voice? Microsoft Word grammar check hates the passive voice, but I never knew what that meant. Try <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">grammarly</a> if you need help, and even if you think you don&rsquo;t. Editing your own work is hard, because your brain will fill in all the things you meant to say but didn&rsquo;t. Also, put the important words at the start of the sentence, just in case the reader dozes off half-way through.</p>

<h3>About Me pages</h3>

<p>Be intentional about the words that describe you in your About Me page<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. Describe your accomplishments with examples, and if possible, try to mirror the language used by the companies you want to work for. Check out the keywords they use, and make sure to encorporate them in your headlines and personal summary.</p>

<blockquote><p>About us pages aren’t really about the company; instead they focus on relaying who they are <em>in relation to the visitor</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>If your reader is an employer, let them know you are for hire &mdash; your posts should always be in the context of what you can do for the reader.</p>

<p>Showing up can be the hardest thing &mdash; finding something original to say, or fearing a public mistake is what keeps many people from writing, but blogging shows you are interested in, well, something. Being interesting means being interested in things, and wanting to share the things you find interesting is a natural follow through. Given the right mentorship, your technical abilities will grow, but getting in the door is step one. So, if you are looking to update your web presence, or create a web presence, this book is for you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The book club I belong to has a two-fold mission: the first is to inspire through peer pressure to read (and finish) technical books, and the second is to improve our ability to write quality, maintainable code. We started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423423708&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=practical+object-oriented+design+in+ruby"><em>Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</em></a> (Sandi Metz), and are now on to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=refactoring&amp;sprefix=refactoring%2Caps%2C217"><em>Refactoring</em></a> (Martin Fowler and Kent Beck). Along the way, I found a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423423781&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+code"><em>Clean Code</em></a> by Robert C. Martin in our work library, and dove right in. These three books tout many of the the same principles but focus on different aspects of writing quality code: POODR teaches how to identify abstractions, and to design decoupled objects; Refactoring is a deep dive into the techniques and heuristics for eliminating common code smells; and Clean Code is the intersection between them. It is a style guide, a call to action, and a cautionary tale from the voices of experience. I had several aha moments while reading Clean Code, and here are a few<!--more-->:</p>

<h3>Error handling</h3>

<p>When I started to anticipate <code>undefined method 'length' for nil:NilClass</code> errors, I knew I was growing as a developer.
Having traced the source of <code>undefined is not a function</code> enough times, I came to realize that I was not sufficiently controlling the messages passing between objects.</p>

<p>This first pass seemed totally reasonable to me &mdash; find a particular user, and return it. Of course, what if the user doesn&rsquo;t exist? What if the query timed out? The code on line 7 is reasonable (wherever it may live), but if <code>@user</code> is set to nil my app will blow up. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='The problem isn&#8217;t that the code is missing a null check, but that it has too many.'>The worst part is, it will blow up at quite a distance from where the actual problem is. A naive solution would be to check if <code>@user</code> is nil before calling <code>#last_name</code> on it (<code>@user.last_name if @user</code>), but this leads to unreadable, untrustworthy code. The problem isn&rsquo;t that the code is missing a null check, but that it has too many. I have a poor contract with <code>User</code> if I have to check its validity every time I ask it a question. Martin suggests a more sustainable solution &mdash; <em>never return <code>nil</code></em>. If you never return <code>nil</code>, you don&rsquo;t have to catch <code>nil</code>.

<blockquote><p>If you are calling a [nil]-returning method from a third-party API, consider wrapping that method with a method that either throws an exception or returns a special case object.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now the error occurs where it belongs &mdash; with the retrieval of the user. Throwing an error when something goes wrong is the least you can do for the consumers of your method. You could also solidify your contract by guaranteeing that you return something they expect.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I have guaranteed that <code>#interesting_things</code> will always return either the collection I expect or a reasonable facscimile. It is a simple enough solution, but I definitely felt that message sink into place. Methods are objects and objects have API&rsquo;s: messages in and messages out. Make those messages deliberate, because if &ldquo;returning null from methods is bad, passing null into methods is worse.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Protect Your Boundaries</h3>

<p>Controlling the messages going in to and coming out of your objects is one place you need to protect your boundaries, but what about objects from 3rd party libraries or frameworks? There are consequences of relying too heavily on a library API, and in Chapter 9: Boundaries, James Grenning shares a few of them. One system he was working with collected information by passing around a Map collection, which is a standard library data structure in Java. In the next version of Java, new capabilities were added, and in order to use the new feature they had to find everywhere the object was used and make the change.</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve seen systems that are inhibited from using [the new feature] because of the sheer magnitude of changes needed to make up for the liberal use of Maps.</p></blockquote>

<p>I recently had a similar experience when upgrading an application from Rails 3.0 to Rails 3.2, where there were drastic changes to how models record errors. Errors inherited from OrderedHash in Rails 3.0 and from ActiveModel in Rails 3.2 &mdash; very different object types. Every test that looked for errors called <code>errors.on</code> &mdash; now a deprecated method. Every place that looped over the collection with <code>errors.each</code> had to be changed to <code>errors.messages.each</code>, or the logic modified altogether. It is good practice to be distrustful of APIs that are likely to change, and while I don&rsquo;t believe that the Errors object ever seemed unstable, it has certainly made me extra cautious of calling 3rd party framework methods directly.</p>

<h3>Clean Code is not a &ldquo;nice-to-have&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Technical debt is not a decision to be okay with untested, brittle code that is impossible to build on &mdash; it is a decision to pursue a design that may not be scalable, but it can still be clean. It is tempting to declare &ldquo;Mission Accomplished&rdquo; when you have reached the point of working code, but the job is really only half done:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is not enough for code to work. Code that works is often badly broken. Programers who satisfy themselves with merely working code are behaving unprofessionally. They may fear that they don&rsquo;t have time to improve the structure and design of their code, but I disagree. Nothing has a more profound and long term degrading effect upon a development project than bad code. Bad schedules can be redone, bad requirements can be redefined. Bad team dynamics can be repaired. But bad code rots and ferments, becoming an inexorable weight that drags the team down.</p></blockquote>

<p>A story cannot be declared finished until the code is ammenable to change. In order to change code, it must be comprehensible and thoroughly tested. Compromising code quality to meet the demands of a schedule will only slow things down in the long run.</p>

<p><em>Clean Code</em> is a must read for all professional software developers. Leaving clean code is not just a kindness to the next developer (which is likely to be you), but is essential for growing a healthy codebase. Of course, &ldquo;to write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it,&rdquo; and I look forward to learning new techniques as we tackle <em>Refactoring</em>.</p>

<p>These are the features I use most often, but checkout the <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">documentation</a> for more.</p>

<h3>Method Method Method</h3>

<p>Method name collisions can happen in a sprawling legacy codebase, so determining the source is important for debugging. The Ruby language has anticipated this difficulty, and since methods are objects themselves, they created the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Method.html">Method</a> module to access the method object. You can source, extract, unbind, and otherwise manipulate methods in a lot of ways:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[1] pry(#&lt;UserTest&gt;)&gt; method = user.method(:full_name)
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; #&lt;Method: User#full_name&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>[2] pry(#&lt;UserTest&gt;)&gt; method.owner
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; User(id: integer, first_name: string, last_name: string, email: string, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>[3] pry(#&lt;UserTest&gt;)&gt; method.source_location
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; ["/Users/keighty/api_playground/app/models/user.rb", 2]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Logger</h3>

<p>Soemtimes the Rails bug you are hunting turns up in the SQL behind your query. When you are in a pry console, the SQL is not displayed by default, but you can turn on query logging by creating an <code>ActiveRecord::Base.logger</code> object:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Globals</h3>

<p>If you are bug hunting deep inside a gem or rails internals, and are trying to pry into a module that is loaded many times before it hits the buggy line of code, a simple <code>binding.pry</code> will have you stepping through an impossible amount of setup. Try setting a global variable to <code>true</code> right before the buggy line, and <code>binding.pry</code> on that condition:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>A global will maintain its state no matter how many times the code is loaded, so be sure to set the variable to false if you are stepping past the first break.</p>

<h3>Caller</h3>

<p>The first 20 or so lines are usually from the pry session so they are easily ignored. I can see that the User.full_name method is being called from my test &mdash; a trivial case, but it comes in very handy when debugging a deeper stack.</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>

<p>When models have many association dependencies, satisfying the validations of many dependencies can be tricky without descriptive errors. In Rails 3.2, the error storage was changed from an <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/3.0.0/ActiveModel/Errors">OrderedHash</a> to a first class ruby object in <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/3.2.8/ActiveModel/Errors">ActiveModel</a>. While the interface has changed, its value remains:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Single table inheritance (STI) is a way to emulate object-oriented inheritance in a relational database<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by storing multiple object types in one table, distinguishable by a discriminator column such as <code>type</code>. Mixing levels of abstraction may make <code>join</code> operations easier, but it also makes other queries more complicated. In Rails 3.2, a query optimization was introduced that had some unintended consequences for STI.</p>

<p>A scope represents a narrowing of a database query, and a named scope is syntactic sugar for defining a class method at runtime.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The scope <code>:in_style</code> is converted into a class method behind the scenes at runtime, and is defined on the singleton class where the scope was named, not on the caller. While this detail has no consequences for objects outside of an inheritance scheme, it means that when PoloShirt invokes the <code>:in_style</code> scope, the class method is declared on Shirt, not PoloShirt.</p>

<p>Here is where the history lesson begins. Scopes have evolved in Rails, and while they remain syntactic sugar for definition class methods, the details, method signature, and sql translation have differed dramatically.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/3.0.0/ActiveRecord/NamedScope/ClassMethods:scope">Rails 3.0</a>, the scope method accepts a name, scope_options, and optional block. Scopes are directly translated into class methods behind the scenes, and the consequences of chaining scopes are the same as chaining queries, just nicer looking.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>PoloShirt.red.in_style.to_sql
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; SELECT * from shirts WHERE color = 'red' where type = 'PoloShirt' where purchase_date &gt;= 1417102745 where type IN ('PoloShirt', 'Sweatshirt')</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice the implicit <code>where</code> clause in STI. The <code>:red</code> scope, declared on PoloShirt has <code>where type = 'PoloShirt'</code>, and the <code>:in_style</code> scope, declared on Shirt, has <code>where type IN ('PoloShirt', 'Sweatshirt')</code>. The second <code>where</code> clause will have no impact on the query results, because they are already scoped to &lsquo;PoloShirt&rsquo;. It is this behaviour that evolves over time.</p>

<p>The first jump in <code>scope</code> evolution is in <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/3.2.8/ActiveRecord/Scoping/Named/ClassMethods:scope">Rails 3.2</a>, where the scope_options can include lambdas. Passing a lambda is a big advantage in that it allows the scope to be re-evaluated each time it is called. Unfortunately the implementation also remixes the query parameters of all chained scopes before evaluation:</p>

<blockquote><p>In nested scopings, all previous parameters are overwritten by the innermost rule, with the exception of <code>where</code>, <code>includes</code>, and <code>joins</code> operations in Relation, which are merged.</p></blockquote>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>PoloShirt.red.in_style.to_sql
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; SELECT * from shirts where color = 'red' where purchase_date &gt;= 1417102745 where type IN ('PoloShirt', 'Sweatshirt')</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first <code>where type =</code> clause is merged with the last <code>where type IN</code> clause. The results of this query will no longer be scoped to PoloShirts, but will return all <code>red.in_style</code> Shirts of any type. Bad news for STI.</p>

<p>The good news is that this behaviour is <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/cd26b6ae">fixed</a> in <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/4.0.0/ActiveRecord/Scoping/Named/ClassMethods#scope-instance_method">Rails 4.0</a>. The latest evolution of scopes no longer allow you to pass a non-callable object (like a hash), and all scopes are merged using AND.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>PoloShirt.red.in_style.to_sql
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; SELECT * from shirts where color = 'red' where purchase_date &gt;= 1417102745 where type = 'PoloShirt' AND type IN ('PoloShirt', 'Sweatshirt')</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Our <code>red.in_style</code> query is once again scoped to the right level of the inheritance heirarchy. Named scopes are chainable and lazy-evaluated, making them a powerful query-building tool that can be difficult to troubleshoot &mdash; especially when they are mixed with single-table inheritance.</p>

    <link href="http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/healthcare-is-a-legacy-application/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/healthcare-is-a-legacy-application</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my favourite blogs is <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org">Brain Pickings</a>, written by Maria Popova, which is a collection of thoughts spanning art, science, psychology, and almost every other subject I read voraciously. Recently I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/17/sherwin-nuland-how-we-die/">this gem</a>, Sherwin B. Nuland&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Die-Sherwin-Nuland-ebook/dp/B004CJ8QCE"><em>How We Die</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It is a raw look at the biological processes that occur at the end of life, which resonated with me on many levels.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The biologist within was fascinated by Nuland&rsquo;s ability to reduce the &ldquo;ten thousand several doors for men to take their exits&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to the same basic process of poor oxygenation and nutrition of vital tissues resulting in organ failure. Whether the process is long or slow, instigated by heart disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, AIDS, accident, or old age, the end must come when the heart stops nourishing the brain.</p>

<p>As a Clinical Professor of Surgery at Yale University, Nuland became intimate with death and its increasingly dehumanizing circumstances. Life’s final chapter has become invisible to most of us. It is likely to be carried out in an intensive care unit, the person reduced to data on a screen, and the advancing disease perceived as a failure of management rather than a natural and inevitable process. He shares the lessons he learned about providing true patient care rather than solving a biological riddle (sometimes the best patient care is no care at all).</p>

<p>Most importantly, he calls attention to the deplorable state of healthcare today, where the &ldquo;provider&rdquo; has usurped the role of the physician:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Our] present system of in-hospital care&hellip; has simply accreted by the constant piling on or insinuation of patches of not necessarily compatible structure to an edifice already jerry-built of competing needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds remarkably like a long-lived legacy application that is impossibly complex and difficult to work in. The healthcare system is in need of a great refactoring, which isn&rsquo;t without precedent (read about Abraham Flexner&rsquo;s report <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lxgTAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Abraham+Flexner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rmXAVIvHLYKYoQSM5YGgDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Medical Education in the United States and Canada</a> that started the movement to raise &ldquo;American medical education&hellip; to the highest [status] in the civilized world&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>)</p>

<p><em>How We Die</em> won the National Book Award, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and perched atop the New York Times&#8217; bestseller list for more than thirty weeks. This book answers a question we have all asked at some point &mdash; what will it be like to die? A hope many of us share is to have a dignified death with little suffering for ourselves and our families, but reflecting on his many years and experiences with death, Nuland has found that</p>

<blockquote><p>the greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to create an abstraction unknowingly or by accident,&rdquo; says Sandi Metz in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421723392&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=practical+object+oriented+design+in+ruby"><em>Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</em></a>. An abstraction is a common, stable quality, such that you would find in a java interface. An interface is an idea that cannot be made concrete, but contains behaviour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_%28Java%29">encoding similarities</a> which objects might share. Even the definition of abstraction is abstract, and it wasn&rsquo;t until I read Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s chapter on Objects and Data Structures in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882"><em>Clean Code</em></a> that I really started to understand them.</p>

<h3>What is a data structure</h3>

<p>A data structure is a class that exposes its data to the public. It should have no meaningful behaviour, and can be characterized by a set of attributes along with getters and setters.</p>

<p>In this example, a Point is defined as an object at some location on a coordinate grid of some kind. That sounds abstract enough: you can create a point, <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Hiding implementation is not about putting a layer of functions between the variables. It is about abstractions.'>access all of the point&rsquo;s data, and set its location along each axis independently. You have an instance of a point, but it is not an abstraction of a point &mdash; it is a data structure. Hiding implementation is not about putting a layer of functions between the variables. It is about abstractions.
</span> Adding an initializer that sets each variable, or a <code>to_s</code> method for getting a pretty output, would not make the Point1 class any more an abstraction of a position in space. To make an abstraction you can&rsquo;t just use getters and setters &mdash; you have to think about how you are representing the data.</p>

<h3>What is an object</h3>

<p>An object hides its data behind abstractions. A Point is not defined by its <code>[@x, @y, @z]</code>, but by its location in space. If space is a coordinate system, it could be 2- or 3-dimensional.</p>

<p>A point cannot exist separate from it&rsquo;s coordinates, and coordinates cannot exist or be altered without using the abstraction of moving in space.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We do not want to expose the details of our data. Rather we want to express our data in abstract terms. This is not merely accomplished by using interfaces and/or getters and setters. Serious thought needs to be put into the best way to represent the data that an object contains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash; Martin</p></blockquote>

<p>This is why <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/">fat models are an anti-pattern in Rails</a>. ActiveRecord makes an object out of a data structure, and adding behaviour beyond data validation makes the model a hybrid data object. <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/398-service-objects">Service Objects</a> are abstractions of model behaviour (pun intended).</p>

<p>Now I know what an abstraction is, and I understand that simply extracting methods into interfaces doesn&rsquo;t magically make an abstraction. As Metz says, &ldquo;good design naturally progresses toward small independent objects that rely on abstractions.&rdquo; An object is more than a data structure; it is an idea and it must be applied deliberately.</p>

    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/number-dup-vs-number-clone-in-ruby-and-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently fixing a failing test and discovered that Ruby and Rails implement <code>#clone</code> and <code>#dup</code> in confusing and occasionally opposite ways.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>In Rails <code>#clone</code> is a less complete copy of an object than <code>#dup</code></h3>

<p>Rails versions have flip-flopped on how to implement <code>#clone</code> and <code>#dup</code>, and there is ambiguity in how Rails defines &ldquo;shallow&rdquo;. In Rails 4.0, <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-0-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/core.rb#L217-L220"><code>#clone</code> is a shallow copy</a> of an ActiveRecord object. &ldquo;Shallow&rdquo; in this context means that the <code>clone</code> shares attributes with the <code>original</code>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Identical to Ruby&rsquo;s clone method.  This is a &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; copy.  Be warned that your attributes are not copied. That means that modifying attributes of the clone will modify the original, since they will both point to the same attributes hash. If you need a copy of your attributes hash, please use the #dup method.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-0-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/core.rb#L234-L240"><code>#dup</code> is also described as a shallow copy</a>. &ldquo;Shallow&rdquo; in this context means that while the dup does not share attributes with the original, it does share associations.</p>

<blockquote><p>Duped objects have no id assigned and are treated as new records. Note that this is a &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; copy as it copies the object&rsquo;s attributes only, not its associations. The extent of a &ldquo;deep&rdquo; copy is application specific and is therefore left to the application to implement according to its need.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the <code>clone_copy</code> is an exact copy of the original (same <code>user.id</code>) and the <code>dup_copy</code> is a new record (<code>user.id</code> = nil). Any changes made to the <code>clone_copy</code> will be changed in the <code>original</code>, but any changes to the <code>dup_copy</code> attributes will remain isolated.</p>

<h3>In Ruby <code>#clone</code> is a more complete copy of an object than <code>#dup</code></h3>

<p>With simple classes, <code>clone()</code> and <code>dup()</code> behave identically:</p>

<p><code>clone()</code> and <code>dup()</code> function the same way!</p>

<p><code>clone()</code> from the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Object.html#method-i-clone">Ruby docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Produces a shallow copy of obj — the instance variables of obj are copied, but not the objects they reference. Copies the frozen and tainted state of obj. See also the discussion under Object#dup.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>dup()</code> from the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Object.html#method-i-dup">Ruby docs</a> looks suspiciously like the docs for <code>clone()</code>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Produces a shallow copy of obj — the instance variables of obj are copied, but not the objects they reference. dup copies the tainted state of obj. This method may have class-specific behavior. If so, that behavior will be documented under the #initialize_copy method of the class.</p></blockquote>

<p>This deserves further clarification:</p>

<blockquote><p>In general, clone and dup may have different semantics in descendant classes. While clone is used to duplicate an object, including its internal state, dup typically uses the class of the descendant object to create the new instance. When using dup any modules that the object has been extended with will not be copied.</p></blockquote>

<p>To paraphrase, <code>#dup</code> will act like <code>#clone</code>, but without the original&rsquo;s singleton class (ergo a &ldquo;shallower&rdquo; copy).</p>

    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/cleaning-the-campground</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you work in a code base with many other contributors, you may have learned the scouting philosophy to &ldquo;leave the campground cleaner than you found it.&rdquo; Sometimes the code you are working in can seem so entangled and complex that it is hard to know where to begin, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420928385&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+code">Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s foundational book, *Clean Code</a>*, tells us that very small changes can improve the readability and maintainability of a piece of code.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is not enough to write the code well. The code has to be <em>kept clean</em> over time.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot">Code rot</a> happens to every well-intentioned but long-lived code base, and it can happen either by neglect or by constant development. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Add in more developers, each with different coding styles, and before long you will find your code to be impenetrably complex and impossible to modify.'>Neglected software will suffer a gradual deterioration in performance and responsiveness over time. Security vulnerabilities and incompatibilities aside, as new applications are built in newer and faster frameworks, your application will perform poorly in comparison. If your software is actively developed it will be modified, and as it is modified it&rsquo;s complexity will increase. Add in more developers, each with different coding styles, and before long you will find your code to be impenetrably complex and impossible to modify.
</span></p>

<p>There is hope for your legacy application, as long as you establish a culture of constant small improvements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change one variable name for the better</li>
<li>Break one large function into two or more smaller ones.</li>
<li>Eliminate one small bit of duplication</li>
<li>Clean up one composite if statement.</li>
</ol>


<p>That last one is a bit like low-hanging fruit. Take this complex if statement in <a href="https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/rack-1.5/lib/rack/deflater.rb#L30-L33">Rack::Deflater#call</a></p>

<p>The comment attempts to explain what the code cannot: skip response compression under certain conditions. The intention could easily be described by extracting both the comment and the if statement to a method:</p>

</span><span class='line'>    return [status, headers, body]
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>  ...
</span><span class='line'>end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>private
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Skip compressing empty entity body responses and responses with
</span><span class='line'># no-transform set.
</span><span class='line'>def skip_compression?
</span><span class='line'>  Utils::STATUS_WITH_NO_ENTITY_BODY.include?(status) ||
</span><span class='line'>    headers['Cache-Control'].to_s =~ /\bno-transform\b/ ||
</span><span class='line'>   (headers['Content-Encoding'] && headers['Content-Encoding'] !~ /\bidentity\b/)
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>While the <code>if</code> statement itself is not much better, at least <code>#call</code> is a little more readable. Fight against code rot while building new features in a legacy code base by making small improvements where you can.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/the-senior-software-engineer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many developers embrace test-driven development (TDD) as an ideal but rarely put it into practice. I often find myself writing code that works and then writing tests that exercise it to ensure that its behaviour doesn&rsquo;t break when changes are made. Writing tests first is a great way to organize your approach to solving a problem, and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Senior-Software-Engineer-Practices-Effective/dp/0990702804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420403139&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=on+being+a+senior+engineer"><strong>The Senior Software Engineer</strong></a>, David Copeland describes how TDD will help you grow your career as well.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>A senior software engineer is efficient, and delivers a quality product in a timely fashion. <span class='pullquote-left' data-pullquote='Effective problem solvers first spend time understanding the problem space and then design a plan'>Effective problem solvers first spend time understanding the problem space and then design a plan: documenting feature behaviour in a test suite allows you to plan your implementation. Code maintenance and modification are also more efficient when you have a good test suite. If the code has been built using TDD, its behaviour is already well tested. When someone needs to build on top of your feature, the tests will protect it and eliminate the worry of causing regressions (win-win).
</span></p>

<p>Explicitly describing your plan in a test suite has another benefit that I had not considered before, and that is making you resilient to interruption. If your plan is not layed out on paper, you are maintaining it all in your head, and you have to hold on to a lot of context in your working memory. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='TDD can help you structure your coding task so that it has natural breaking points. If you are interrupted while trying to fix a failing test, you know exactly where you can pick the task up again.'>Every time you are interrupted, you have to dump things out of your working memory, and reloading the problem space takes time and energy. You won&rsquo;t suffer interruptions well if reloading the context takes 15 minutes each time. You will become unresponsive as you block out the outside world, trying to maintain your context.</p>

<p>TDD can help you structure your coding task so that it has natural breaking points. If you are interrupted while trying to fix a failing test, you know exactly where you can pick the task up again. If you are interrupted after getting a test to pass you can easily read through your test suite to regain your context and pick up the next task.
</span></p>

<p>Time and context management are essential skills for becoming a senior software engineer, and I am going to try using test driven development to become more interruptable and more productive.</p>

OUTLINE
Test-driven development can help you grow your career.
1. test-driven development is an ideal that many strive for and few embrace.
2. many developers embrace the ideas of test-driven development, but few practice it rigorously.
3. writing tests is important to delivering quality, robust code, and is essential for writing code that you ever hope to change.
4. did you know that test-driven development can help you grow your career as well?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently upgraded my home hardware from an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-1000HE-10-1-Inch-Black-Netbook/dp/B001QTXL82">Asus 10.1&#8221; netbook</a> to a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">15&#8221; MacBook Pro</a>, and once I adjusted to being able to open more than one window at a time, I got down to the business of loading my files and projects on the new machine. Thanks to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, most of that work happens either behind the scenes or as needed. Recreating the right environment for each project is still ongoing, and the first challenge I encountered was reloading my blog &mdash; started about two years ago using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.</p>

<p>Octopress is an awesome framework built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. The learning curve for getting started with jekyll was a little steep (liquid layouts, yaml, not to mention design and UX were all new to me then) , and Octopress delivers on its promise to make it easy: just clone, bundle, and blog. Part of what makes Octopress so awesome is the deploy strategy: static pages are generated from yaml and markdown sources (saved in the source branch), and the pages are checked in to your github or heroku repository (as the master branch).</p>

<p>When you clone the repo, you get both branches, but you have to do a little setup to ensure that master is pulling from and pushing to the right place. Borrowing some code from the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/Rakefile#L351-L358">setup rake task</a>:</p>

<p>Now I have no excuses to not blog more often&hellip; well, fewer excuses (thanks to <a href="http://code.dblock.org/octopress-setting-up-a-blog-and-contributing-to-an-existing-one">Daniel Doubrovkine</a> for pointing me in the right direction).</p>

<p>I briefly considered switching to a hosted blogging platform (tumblr or wordpress), so I conducted an informal survey (sample size taken from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/20-developers-to-follow-in-2014/">Digital Ocean&rsquo;s 20 developers to follow</a>) to see what choices leading developers were making, and it looks like a jekyll based blog is still the most popular. What is yours?</p>

    <link href="http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/the-happiness-hypothesis/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/the-happiness-hypothesis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.&rdquo; &mdash;Buddha</p></blockquote>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/0465028020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420146441&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+happiness+hypothesis">The Happiness Hypothesis</a>: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, Jonathan Haidt provides an extensive overview of the state of positive psychology today.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>He uses the analogy of a rider on an elephant to describe how the mind is divided into two parts: the conscious, reasoning part (the rider), and the unconscious mind that is actually driving our behaviour (the elephant). Stepping in to the New Year, the twitter-verse is alive with resolutions to eat less, exercise more, and spend less money &mdash; all laudable goals for the rider, but unless you can re-train the elephant to want those same things, you will find yourself in line for a 16oz hot chocolate with whipped cream by the end of the week.</p>

<h3>On the happiness equation: H = S + C + V</h3>

<blockquote><p>The level of happiness that you actually experience (H) is determined by your biological set point (S) plus the conditions of your life &copy; plus the voluntary activities (V) you do.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has certainly been true in my life. I tend towards a positive outlook (as Haidt describes it, a winner of the &lsquo;cortical lottery&rsquo;), but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t experience ups and downs brought on by circumstances and choices. Changing your level of happiness can come from changing your circumstances, or by participating in rewarding acitivites. (Out of ideas? Try <a href="http://www.bodyvox.com/classes/beginning-ballet-and-wine-tasting-0">beginning ballet and wine tasting</a>!)</p>

<h3>On training the elephant</h3>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The goal of meditation is to change automatic thought processes, thereby taming the elephant. And the proof of taming is the breaking of attachments&hellip; For Buddha, attachments are like a game of roulette in which someone else spins the wheel and the game is rigged: The more you play, the more you lose. The only way to win is to step away from the table. And the only way to step away, to make yourself not react to the ups and downs of life, is to meditate and tame the mind. Although you give up the pleasures of winning, you also give up the larger pains of losing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I like the idea of training the elephant through meditation, but disagree with the pursuit of non-attachment. Living life without any attachments means missing out on joy as well as pain. If life is an amuzement park, is it better to spend your time on the teacups or the rollercoaster? Isn&rsquo;t it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all?</p>

<h3>On your inner lawyer</h3>

<blockquote><p>[People] are skilled at finding reasons to support their gut feelings. The rider acts like a lawyer whom the elephant has hired to represent it in the court of public opinion&hellip; Studies of everyday reasoning show that&hellip; when people are given difficult questions to think about&hellip; they generally lean one way or the other right away, and then put a call in to reasoning to see whether support for that position is forthcoming.</p></blockquote>

<p>I love the idea of our conscious mind acting as a lawyer defending our actions and decisions. We only look for supporting evidence, and any data that undermines our world-view must be discredited or its importance downplayed.</p>

<h3>On reciprocation and gossip</h3>

<blockquote><p>A species equipped with vengeance and gratitude responses can support larger and more cooperative social groups because the payoff to cheaters is reduced by the costs they bear in making enemies&hellip; Tit for tat appears to be built into human nature as a set of moral emotions that make us want to return favor for favor, insult for insult&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Social groups cannot be formed without cooperation and a set of norms. Norms can be enforced through gossip:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many species reciprocate, but only humans gossip, and much of what we gossip about is the value of other people as partners for reciprocal relationships&hellip; Gossip paired with reciprocity allow karma to work here on earth, not in the next life.</p></blockquote>

<h3>On writing your life story</h3>

<blockquote><p>The third level of personality is that of the &ldquo;life story.&rdquo; Human beings in every culture are fascinated by stories; we create them wherever we can.. It&rsquo;s no different with our own lives. We can&rsquo;t stop ourselves from creating what McAdams describes as an &ldquo;evolving story that integrates a reconstructed past, perceived present, and anticipated future into a coherent and vitalizing life myth.&rdquo; Although the lowest level of personality is mostly about the elephant, the life story is written primarily by the rider. You create your story in consciousness as you interpret your own behavior, and as you listen to other people&rsquo;s thoughts about you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Every time I relate a personal anecdote to a new listener I find that I am refining the narrative &mdash; using the same words and phrases, pausing at the same moments each time. My partner and I have developed a cadence when we tell people about our drive across Canada, or our trip to the Maritimes. We are building our life story through relatable moments.</p>

<h3>On growing through adversity</h3>

<blockquote><p>Be sure you have done your best to answer these two questions: Why did this happen? What good might I derive from it?</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever doesn&rsquo;t kill you doesn&rsquo;t always make you stronger, but we can grow through adversity. Pain doesn&rsquo;t always equal gain, but a root cause analysis (why did this happen?), and reframing to find something positive in the experience (lessons learned), is a great approach.</p>

<h3>On the ideological differences in moral ethics:</h3>

<blockquote><p>The ethic of autonomy, the ethic of community, and the ethic of divinity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Policial and ideological differences arise from approaching life from different moral perspectives. In the ethic of autonomy, the goal is to protect individuals from harm and interference. In the ethic of community the goal is to protect the integrity of groups, families, companies, or nations, and its virtues are obedience, and loyalty. In the ethic of divinity, the goal is to protect the sacred from the profane. They value living in a pure and holy way, free from pollutants such as lust, greed, and hatred.</p>

<h3>Vital engagement (or flow)</h3>

<blockquote><p>Vital engagement does not reside in the person or in the environment; it exists in the relationship between the two.</p></blockquote>

<p>Memories that encorporate more than one sensation are the strongest. Similarly, finding meaning and flow in an activity requires more than just a connection through commitment. There must be connections through a community, a shared history, and a shared experience. I didn&rsquo;t come to love programming because it seemed like a rewarding career path. I built a script that was useful to a coworker, drew excitment from other programmers, and began peeling back the layers of abstraction, enjoying the &lsquo;A-ha!&rsquo; when understanding occurred.</p>

<h3>On happiness and the meaning of life</h3>

<blockquote><p>Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conidtions right and then wait.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the first book I have read that really tried to approach the meaning of life, and my inner elephant has decided that Haidt is on the right track.</p>

    <link href="http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2014/method-lookup-in-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated>

<p>In Chapter 6 (Acquiring behaviour through inheritance), she describes how to extract a superclass from a group of related classes that share some behaviour by pulling methods up the inheritance chain instead of driving specializations down. This approach ensures a clean abstraction, leaving no specialized behaviour in the superclass. Where I got stuck was in the call chain that enforces the common interface:</p>

<p>I could not understand why, the <code>NotImplementedError</code> wasn&rsquo;t raised when a new <code>Bar</code> was created. This is how I imagined the call stack should work:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Bar.new</code> calls <code>Bar#initialize</code></li>
<li><code>Bar</code> calls <code>super</code> (<code>Foo#initialize</code>)</li>
<li><code>Foo</code> calls <code>baz</code> (<code>Foo#baz</code>)</li>
<li>raises <code>NotImplementedError</code></li>
</ol>


<p>This is how the call stack actually works</p>

<ol>
<li><code>x = Bar.new</code> calls <code>Bar#initialize</code></li>
<li><code>x</code> receives a call to <code>super</code> (<code>Foo#initalize</code>)</li>
<li><code>x</code> receives a call to <code>baz</code> (<code>Bar#baz</code>)</li>
<li>says &ldquo;Hello, baz&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<p>The call never comes from the context of <code>Foo</code> &mdash; the receiver is always <code>x</code>, the instance of <code>Bar</code>. Classical inheritance dictates that an object can only look to itself or further up the inheritance chain for valid method definitions, not down. <code>x</code> is reaching up to call <code>super</code> but checks itself for an answer to the question <code>#baz</code>. <code>Foo#baz</code> would only ever be called if we made a new <code>Foo</code> directly:</p>

<h3>How ruby resolves a message (classical inheritance)</h3>

<p>The search for a method begins in the class of the receiving object &mdash; in the example above, Bar is always the receiving object. If the class does not implement the message, the search proceeds up the superclass chain. If none of the superclasses contain the method definition, ruby makes a second attempt to resolve the message by sending <code>method_missing(:method_name)</code> to the original object. The search restarts from the bottom, but this time for a <code>method_missing</code> handler rather than <code>:method_name</code>.</p>

<p>Occasionally refreshing the ruby basics is super-rewarding.</p>
