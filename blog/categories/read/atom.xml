    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Everybody Writes</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Ann Handley teaches content marketers how to generate &ldquo;ridiculously good&rdquo; content. Anyone who has recently enjoyed the pain of the job hunt will notice that much of the advice can be adapted to self-marketing. In my recent code school experience, developing an online presence was as important as learning web development, and since it is hard to market yourself as a web developer without developing anything for the web, a blog is a great place to start. You have picked a career where your ability to learn is one of your most marketable skills, as well as your ability to communicate &mdash; both of which you can showcase in your blog. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about having something original to say: treat it as an opportunity to organize your thoughts and to teach a beginner what you know. Handley gives great advice for people learning to blog and how to generally optimize your online presence &mdash; both are great ways to market yourself as a fresh code-school alum.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Show up</h3>

<p>Write early, write often. If something is new to you, it will likely be new to someone else as well. The more writing practice you get, the easier it becomes &mdash; &ldquo;writing is a habit, not an art&rdquo;, and you can&rsquo;t help but improve in an art that you practice every day. Handley recommends starting with the ugly first draft<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> &mdash; make it ugly, don&rsquo;t delete anything, don&rsquo;t rephrase or reread. Just get it out of you and on to your screen, then walk away for a day. Maybe two. If you are really stuck on how to begin, you could start with &ldquo;Dear diary&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This helps you get in the mood to write, and keeps your tone conversational. Also, if you are writing to a non-technical person, it will keep your writing clear, and inspire you to give enough back story so that they aren&rsquo;t lost.</p>

<h3>Write a tight post</h3>

<h4>Decide on a goal</h4>

<p>Is it to teach? To share? To critique? The goal for technical blogs is not usually to obtain a following &mdash; it is to share a bit of experience that will turn up when another frustrated developer puts keywords into a search engine. An online presence is important, but it should not be a blow by blow of how hard it is to learn to code. A handy formula for creating quality content is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Utility * Inspiration * Empathy = Quality Content<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Make it useful, make it reader centric (even if that reader is you six months from now), and make it thoughtful.</p>

<h4>Forget the 5 paragraph essay format from high school</h4>

<p>I rarely read a long blog post from beginning to end, and the sweet spot for length is around 1500 words<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. Make it easy for the reader to get the gist of your post by providing sub-headings, bold text, and code samples &mdash; these are strong visual elements that can help your reader anchor what they are learning.</p>

<h4>Rewrite</h4>

<p>Once you have written the ugly first draft with your goal in mind, rewrite it with the reader in mind &mdash; will they understand the context of what you are trying to get across? Assume the reader knows nothing, but isn’t stupid. Find data and examples that illustrate what you are trying to share (and make sure that you give credit where credit is due<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>).</p>

<h4>Work on your grammar</h4>

<p>After reframing, examine your sentence structure. Are you using a passive voice? Microsoft Word grammar check hates the passive voice, but I never knew what that meant. Try <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">grammarly</a> if you need help, and even if you think you don&rsquo;t. Editing your own work is hard, because your brain will fill in all the things you meant to say but didn&rsquo;t. Also, put the important words at the start of the sentence, just in case the reader dozes off half-way through.</p>

<h3>About Me pages</h3>

<p>Be intentional about the words that describe you in your About Me page<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. Describe your accomplishments with examples, and if possible, try to mirror the language used by the companies you want to work for. Check out the keywords they use, and make sure to encorporate them in your headlines and personal summary.</p>

<blockquote><p>About us pages aren’t really about the company; instead they focus on relaying who they are <em>in relation to the visitor</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>If your reader is an employer, let them know you are for hire &mdash; your posts should always be in the context of what you can do for the reader.</p>

<p>Showing up can be the hardest thing &mdash; finding something original to say, or fearing a public mistake is what keeps many people from writing, but blogging shows you are interested in, well, something. Being interesting means being interested in things, and wanting to share the things you find interesting is a natural follow through. Given the right mentorship, your technical abilities will grow, but getting in the door is step one. So, if you are looking to update your web presence, or create a web presence, this book is for you.</p>

    <link href="http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/healthcare-is-a-legacy-application/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/healthcare-is-a-legacy-application</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my favourite blogs is <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org">Brain Pickings</a>, written by Maria Popova, which is a collection of thoughts spanning art, science, psychology, and almost every other subject I read voraciously. Recently I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/17/sherwin-nuland-how-we-die/">this gem</a>, Sherwin B. Nuland&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Die-Sherwin-Nuland-ebook/dp/B004CJ8QCE"><em>How We Die</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It is a raw look at the biological processes that occur at the end of life, which resonated with me on many levels.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The biologist within was fascinated by Nuland&rsquo;s ability to reduce the &ldquo;ten thousand several doors for men to take their exits&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to the same basic process of poor oxygenation and nutrition of vital tissues resulting in organ failure. Whether the process is long or slow, instigated by heart disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, AIDS, accident, or old age, the end must come when the heart stops nourishing the brain.</p>

<p>As a Clinical Professor of Surgery at Yale University, Nuland became intimate with death and its increasingly dehumanizing circumstances. Life’s final chapter has become invisible to most of us. It is likely to be carried out in an intensive care unit, the person reduced to data on a screen, and the advancing disease perceived as a failure of management rather than a natural and inevitable process. He shares the lessons he learned about providing true patient care rather than solving a biological riddle (sometimes the best patient care is no care at all).</p>

<p>Most importantly, he calls attention to the deplorable state of healthcare today, where the &ldquo;provider&rdquo; has usurped the role of the physician:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Our] present system of in-hospital care&hellip; has simply accreted by the constant piling on or insinuation of patches of not necessarily compatible structure to an edifice already jerry-built of competing needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds remarkably like a long-lived legacy application that is impossibly complex and difficult to work in. The healthcare system is in need of a great refactoring, which isn&rsquo;t without precedent (read about Abraham Flexner&rsquo;s report <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lxgTAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Abraham+Flexner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rmXAVIvHLYKYoQSM5YGgDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Medical Education in the United States and Canada</a> that started the movement to raise &ldquo;American medical education&hellip; to the highest [status] in the civilized world&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>)</p>

<p><em>How We Die</em> won the National Book Award, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and perched atop the New York Times' bestseller list for more than thirty weeks. This book answers a question we have all asked at some point &mdash; what will it be like to die? A hope many of us share is to have a dignified death with little suffering for ourselves and our families, but reflecting on his many years and experiences with death, Nuland has found that</p>

<blockquote><p>the greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.</p></blockquote>

    <updated>2015-01-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/cleaning-the-campground</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you work in a code base with many other contributors, you may have learned the scouting philosophy to &ldquo;leave the campground cleaner than you found it.&rdquo; Sometimes the code you are working in can seem so entangled and complex that it is hard to know where to begin, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420928385&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+code">Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s foundational book, *Clean Code</a>*, tells us that very small changes can improve the readability and maintainability of a piece of code.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is not enough to write the code well. The code has to be <em>kept clean</em> over time.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot">Code rot</a> happens to every well-intentioned but long-lived code base, and it can happen either by neglect or by constant development. Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>There is hope for your legacy application, as long as you establish a culture of constant small improvements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change one variable name for the better</li>
<li>Break one large function into two or more smaller ones.</li>
<li>Eliminate one small bit of duplication</li>
<li>Clean up one composite if statement.</li>
</ol>


<p>That last one is a bit like low-hanging fruit. Take this complex if statement in <a href="https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/rack-1.5/lib/rack/deflater.rb#L30-L33">Rack::Deflater#call</a></p>

<p>```
def call
  &hellip;</p>

<p>  # Skip compressing empty entity body responses and responses with
  # no-transform set.
  if Utils::STATUS_WITH_NO_ENTITY_BODY.include?(status) ||</p>

<pre><code>  headers['Cache-Control'].to_s =~ /\bno-transform\b/ ||
 (headers['Content-Encoding'] &amp;&amp; headers['Content-Encoding'] !~ /\bidentity\b/)
return [status, headers, body]
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  &hellip;
```</p>

<p>The comment attempts to explain what the code cannot: skip response compression under certain conditions. The intention could easily be described by extracting both the comment and the if statement to a method:</p>

<p>```
def call
  &hellip;
  if skip_compression?</p>

<pre><code>return [status, headers, body]
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  &hellip;
end</p>

<p>private</p>

<h1>Skip compressing empty entity body responses and responses with</h1>

<h1>no-transform set.</h1>

<p>def skip_compression?
  Utils::STATUS_WITH_NO_ENTITY_BODY.include?(status) ||</p>

<pre><code>headers['Cache-Control'].to_s =~ /\bno-transform\b/ ||
</code></pre>

<p>   (headers[&lsquo;Content-Encoding&rsquo;] &amp;&amp; headers[&lsquo;Content-Encoding&rsquo;] !~ /\bidentity\b/)
end
```</p>

<p>While the <code>if</code> statement itself is not much better, at least <code>#call</code> is a little more readable. Fight against code rot while building new features in a legacy code base by making small improvements where you can.</p>

    <link href="http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/the-senior-software-engineer/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/the-senior-software-engineer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many developers embrace test-driven development (TDD) as an ideal but rarely put it into practice. I often find myself writing code that works and then writing tests that exercise it to ensure that its behaviour doesn&rsquo;t break when changes are made. Writing tests first is a great way to organize your approach to solving a problem, and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Senior-Software-Engineer-Practices-Effective/dp/0990702804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420403139&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=on+being+a+senior+engineer"><strong>The Senior Software Engineer</strong></a>, David Copeland describes how TDD will help you grow your career as well.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>A senior software engineer is efficient, and delivers a quality product in a timely fashion. Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>Explicitly describing your plan in a test suite has another benefit that I had not considered before, and that is making you resilient to interruption. If your plan is not layed out on paper, you are maintaining it all in your head, and you have to hold on to a lot of context in your working memory. Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>Time and context management are essential skills for becoming a senior software engineer, and I am going to try using test driven development to become more interruptable and more productive.</p>

OUTLINE
Test-driven development can help you grow your career.
1. test-driven development is an ideal that many strive for and few embrace.
2. many developers embrace the ideas of test-driven development, but few practice it rigorously.
3. writing tests is important to delivering quality, robust code, and is essential for writing code that you ever hope to change.
4. did you know that test-driven development can help you grow your career as well?

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Happiness Hypothesis]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/the-happiness-hypothesis/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/the-happiness-hypothesis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.&rdquo; &mdash;Buddha</p></blockquote>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/0465028020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420146441&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+happiness+hypothesis">The Happiness Hypothesis</a>: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, Jonathan Haidt provides an extensive overview of the state of positive psychology today.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>He uses the analogy of a rider on an elephant to describe how the mind is divided into two parts: the conscious, reasoning part (the rider), and the unconscious mind that is actually driving our behaviour (the elephant). Stepping in to the New Year, the twitter-verse is alive with resolutions to eat less, exercise more, and spend less money &mdash; all laudable goals for the rider, but unless you can re-train the elephant to want those same things, you will find yourself in line for a 16oz hot chocolate with whipped cream by the end of the week.</p>

<h3>On the happiness equation: H = S + C + V</h3>

<blockquote><p>The level of happiness that you actually experience (H) is determined by your biological set point (S) plus the conditions of your life &copy; plus the voluntary activities (V) you do.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has certainly been true in my life. I tend towards a positive outlook (as Haidt describes it, a winner of the &lsquo;cortical lottery&rsquo;), but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t experience ups and downs brought on by circumstances and choices. Changing your level of happiness can come from changing your circumstances, or by participating in rewarding acitivites. (Out of ideas? Try <a href="http://www.bodyvox.com/classes/beginning-ballet-and-wine-tasting-0">beginning ballet and wine tasting</a>!)</p>

<h3>On training the elephant</h3>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The goal of meditation is to change automatic thought processes, thereby taming the elephant. And the proof of taming is the breaking of attachments&hellip; For Buddha, attachments are like a game of roulette in which someone else spins the wheel and the game is rigged: The more you play, the more you lose. The only way to win is to step away from the table. And the only way to step away, to make yourself not react to the ups and downs of life, is to meditate and tame the mind. Although you give up the pleasures of winning, you also give up the larger pains of losing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I like the idea of training the elephant through meditation, but disagree with the pursuit of non-attachment. Living life without any attachments means missing out on joy as well as pain. If life is an amuzement park, is it better to spend your time on the teacups or the rollercoaster? Isn&rsquo;t it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all?</p>

<h3>On your inner lawyer</h3>

<blockquote><p>[People] are skilled at finding reasons to support their gut feelings. The rider acts like a lawyer whom the elephant has hired to represent it in the court of public opinion&hellip; Studies of everyday reasoning show that&hellip; when people are given difficult questions to think about&hellip; they generally lean one way or the other right away, and then put a call in to reasoning to see whether support for that position is forthcoming.</p></blockquote>

<p>I love the idea of our conscious mind acting as a lawyer defending our actions and decisions. We only look for supporting evidence, and any data that undermines our world-view must be discredited or its importance downplayed.</p>

<h3>On reciprocation and gossip</h3>

<blockquote><p>A species equipped with vengeance and gratitude responses can support larger and more cooperative social groups because the payoff to cheaters is reduced by the costs they bear in making enemies&hellip; Tit for tat appears to be built into human nature as a set of moral emotions that make us want to return favor for favor, insult for insult&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Social groups cannot be formed without cooperation and a set of norms. Norms can be enforced through gossip:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many species reciprocate, but only humans gossip, and much of what we gossip about is the value of other people as partners for reciprocal relationships&hellip; Gossip paired with reciprocity allow karma to work here on earth, not in the next life.</p></blockquote>

<h3>On writing your life story</h3>

<blockquote><p>The third level of personality is that of the &ldquo;life story.&rdquo; Human beings in every culture are fascinated by stories; we create them wherever we can.. It&rsquo;s no different with our own lives. We can&rsquo;t stop ourselves from creating what McAdams describes as an &ldquo;evolving story that integrates a reconstructed past, perceived present, and anticipated future into a coherent and vitalizing life myth.&rdquo; Although the lowest level of personality is mostly about the elephant, the life story is written primarily by the rider. You create your story in consciousness as you interpret your own behavior, and as you listen to other people&rsquo;s thoughts about you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Every time I relate a personal anecdote to a new listener I find that I am refining the narrative &mdash; using the same words and phrases, pausing at the same moments each time. My partner and I have developed a cadence when we tell people about our drive across Canada, or our trip to the Maritimes. We are building our life story through relatable moments.</p>

<h3>On growing through adversity</h3>

<blockquote><p>Be sure you have done your best to answer these two questions: Why did this happen? What good might I derive from it?</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever doesn&rsquo;t kill you doesn&rsquo;t always make you stronger, but we can grow through adversity. Pain doesn&rsquo;t always equal gain, but a root cause analysis (why did this happen?), and reframing to find something positive in the experience (lessons learned), is a great approach.</p>

<h3>On the ideological differences in moral ethics:</h3>

<blockquote><p>The ethic of autonomy, the ethic of community, and the ethic of divinity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Policial and ideological differences arise from approaching life from different moral perspectives. In the ethic of autonomy, the goal is to protect individuals from harm and interference. In the ethic of community the goal is to protect the integrity of groups, families, companies, or nations, and its virtues are obedience, and loyalty. In the ethic of divinity, the goal is to protect the sacred from the profane. They value living in a pure and holy way, free from pollutants such as lust, greed, and hatred.</p>

<h3>Vital engagement (or flow)</h3>

<blockquote><p>Vital engagement does not reside in the person or in the environment; it exists in the relationship between the two.</p></blockquote>

<p>Memories that encorporate more than one sensation are the strongest. Similarly, finding meaning and flow in an activity requires more than just a connection through commitment. There must be connections through a community, a shared history, and a shared experience. I didn&rsquo;t come to love programming because it seemed like a rewarding career path. I built a script that was useful to a coworker, drew excitment from other programmers, and began peeling back the layers of abstraction, enjoying the &lsquo;A-ha!&rsquo; when understanding occurred.</p>

<h3>On happiness and the meaning of life</h3>

<blockquote><p>Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conidtions right and then wait.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the first book I have read that really tried to approach the meaning of life, and my inner elephant has decided that Haidt is on the right track.</p>
