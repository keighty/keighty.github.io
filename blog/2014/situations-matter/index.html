Social psychologists call it &ldquo;fundamental attribution error&rdquo;, which is a tendency to interpret someone else&rsquo;s behavior as stemming from their core characteristics, rather than to external circumstances. A simplistic example of attribution error is assuming that the person driving the speeding car is a reckless speed-freak rather than someone rushing a woman in labor to the hospital. Sommers has studied the power of situations over human interactions and how the attribution error interferes with our ability to empathize with the unfamiliar. I have read similar studies of how bias infiltrates our relationships, but what surprised me the most is how it also influences our perception of the self. <!--more--></p>

<h3>You&rsquo;re not the person you thought you were</h3>

<p>A provocative but aptly named chapter, Sommers overturns the concept of an &ldquo;authentic self&rdquo; with a simple fill-in-the-blanks exercise:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am _________________</li>
<li>I am _________________</li>
<li>I am _________________</li>
<li>I am _________________</li>
<li>I am _________________</li>
</ol>


<p>His study subjects were required to fill in 20 of these blanks, but 5 is enough to illustrate his point to the reader. The open-endedness of this exercise allows for a fantastic range of responses: &ldquo;I am 36 years old, I am hungry, I am tall, I am a lifelong learner&rdquo;. Taking the 20 questions test in different contexts will yield different definitions of yourself. Sommers has discovered that &ldquo;we tend to think of ourselves in terms of that which makes us distinctive&rdquo;, so your answers will have more to do with the people around you than with a fixed set of characteristics. A woman is more likely to include gender on her list if she is in a room full of men than if she is in a room full of women. So it seems that &ldquo;identity is malleable and personal preferences are constructed on the spot.&rdquo; Introspection will gain us little but a hazy snap-shot of our identity at any given moment.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s refreshing to realize that you&rsquo;re not a finished product &mdash; that who you are in the here and now may not be the same person you&rsquo;ll be in the then and there. In fact, it&rsquo;s the opposite view of the self as a fixed entity that causes problems. When you assume that there&rsquo;s a true core self waiting to be discovered, that&rsquo;s when your potential seems limited and the world around you is full of threats to be rationalized away.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>One quality that is typically presumed to be fixed is intelligence. Challenging this truism, another study was conducted where students were grouped according to their belief that either intelligence is a stable attribute, or that their intellect can be changed. The researchers asked the students to predict the likelihood that they will attend a remedial language course, and then tracked their performance. It was found that among the students who fared poorly in the language course, those who viewed intelligence as a permanent, unchangeable trait were less likely to enroll in the remedial course &mdash; that is, to take steps in order to improve their performance. For students who believe that intelligence is fixed, a poor exam grade is a mark of their limitations rather than an opportunity for improvement. Students who believe that intelligence is malleable are more likely to show the stick-to-itiveness necessary for self-improvement.</p>

<p>Viewing the self less like a rigid Rubik&rsquo;s Cube to be solved, and more like Silly Putty that conforms to the shape of its container, will likely free up a lot of my time. Instead of trying to solve the puzzle. I can spend energy on finding the container that makes me happy&hellip; for the moment.</p>
