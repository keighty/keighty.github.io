Well, hello! I'm a very proud Canadian, hailing from Vancouver, British Columbia, living the glamorous expatriot life in Portland, Oregon. I'm a software developer by profession, but as you can probably tell by the mishmash of stuff on this blog, I am interested in a lot of different things. I love to read, and my obsessions are personal productivity, psychology, and history. I love to travel, because it forces me to be uncomfortable -- I believe that growth only happens by being uncomfortable -- which is why I am always learning new technology stacks.

2016 was a breakout year of technical growth for me, learning how to build instrumentation for JavaScript applications and how to work in a high-throughput production Java system. I have taken courses in algorithms, graphic design, concurrency, and browser performance testing, and (thanks to [Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/), I am now an expert in ES6 and esoteric browser APIs :D ). I built a few apps for personal use, including a [learning grid](https://learning-grid.herokuapp.com/), [interview preparation site](http://keighty.questions.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html), and a [creativity inspiration site](http://keighty.wordplay.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html), as well as a [data parsing app](https://parse-amazon-data.herokuapp.com/) for a friend.

The next side projects I have in mind include exploring the use of web workers (perhaps with an implementation of Conway's Game of Life), and finishing the rewrite of Virtual Playbill into React (possibly building a hybrid app?). I am hoping to continue to travel this year with an emphasis on spending more time out of doors. So far, we are planning Alaska, Boston, and Montreal.
