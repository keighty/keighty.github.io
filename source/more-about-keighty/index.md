Well, hello! I'm a very proud Canadian, hailing from Vancouver, British Columbia, living the glamorous expatriot life in Portland, Oregon. I'm a software developer by profession, but as you can probably tell by the mishmash of stuff on this blog, I am interested in a lot of different things. I love to read, and my current obsessions are personal productivity, management, and history. I love to travel, because it forces me to be uncomfortable -- I feel that growth only happens by being uncomfortable -- which is why I am also exploring public speaking, managment, and self-publishing.

This has been a busy year for me: I recently launched an ebook ([_So You Want to Go to Code School?_](http://codeschoolbook.com/buy-the-book/)) about my experience in code school, expanded the feature set of my personal theatre tracking application, [Virtual Playbill](https://virtual-playbill.herokuapp.com), and shipped an epic project at work (check out [Hunting Monkey Patches](http://katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/hunting-monkey-patches/), [Local Load Balancing](http://katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/local-load-balancing/), [#dup vs #clone](http://katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/number-dup-vs-number-clone-in-ruby-and-rails/), and [Scopes and Single Table Inheritance](http://katieleonard.ca/blog/2015/scopes-and-single-table-inheritance/) for a peek into that learning curve). I also joined a new team and started scaling another mountain of information: JavaScript and browsers.

My next big projects include building an application for tracking learning goals, expanding Virtual Playbill to accommodate multiple user collections, and to keep traveling (this year I am looking forward to seeing Hawaii, Ecuador, and the Galapagos Islands). I am also interested in improving my design chops, so check back in on [Virtual Playbill](https://virtual-playbill.herokuapp.com/signup)] for much needed UX and UI improvements!
