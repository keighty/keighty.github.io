## Learning Grid
Using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) to track my [learning goals](http://learninggrid.meteor.com/) is easy! As I go, I can move a javascript MVVM from "Learning Zone" to "Comfort Zone", and manage my future projects along the way.

##Eh?
(Eh?)[http://www.katieleonard.ca/eh-/index.html] is a programming language I am building using idiomatic Canadianisms. I am gaining a greater understanding of how languages function, and love considering what features I want in a language.

*(Solitaire)[http://js-games.herokuapp.com/solitaire]: Similar to peg solitaire, the object of the game is to turn all the squares blue.
*(Mastermind)[http://js-games.herokuapp.com/mastermind]: Like the board game, Mastermind is a single-player code-breaking game.
*(Animal Quiz)[http://js-games.herokuapp.com/animalquiz]: An artificial intelligence game for teaching a database to guess the animal you are thinking of.

##Code Samples
I used (Docco)[http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/] to generate annotated documentation for some useful pieces of code.(<i class="fa fa-github"></i>)[http://github.com/keighty/PCSnotes/tree/gh-pages]
