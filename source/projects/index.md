<h2><a href="https://github.com/keighty/virtualplaybill2"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Virtual Playbill</h2>
Since moving to Portland, my partner and I have been seeing more theater than we can track. I originally [built the app in meteor](https://github.com/keighty/virtual_playbill), and then in node, angular, and mongodb. Check out my progress at [virtual-playbill.herokuapp.com](https://virtual-playbill.herokuapp.com/).

<h2><a href="http://github.com/keighty/learningGrid"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Learning Grid</h2>
Using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) to track my [learning goals](http://learninggrid.meteor.com/) is easy! As I go, I can move a javascript MVVM from "Learning Zone" to "Comfort Zone", and manage my future projects along the way.

<h2><a href="http://github.com/keighty/eh-"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Eh?</h2>
[Eh?](http://www.katieleonard.ca/eh-/index.html) is a programming language I am building using idiomatic Canadianisms. I am gaining a greater understanding of how languages function, and love considering what features are useful/essential in a language.

```
a Canadian
with toque
with scarf
with broom

can curl
    if skip
      say "Hurry!"
    elsif lead
      say "That's too much ice..."
    eh?
  eh?
eh?
```
