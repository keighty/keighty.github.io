<h2><a href="http://codeschoolbook.com">So You Want to Go to Code School</a></h2>
Going to code school was a hard decision to make, and I made it with surprisingly little information. It was an amazing but difficult experience, and if I knew then what I know now, I may have relaxed a little more along the way. Two years after code school, I started giving talks and writing blogs about lessons I have learned, and I had a lot more to say than this blog would support. I wrote this ebook guide for anyone who is considering going to code school.

Since moving to Portland, my partner and I have been seeing more theater than we can track. I originally [built the app in meteor](http://github.com/keighty/virtual_playbill), and then in node, angular, and mongodb. Check out my progress at [virtual-playbill.herokuapp.com](https://virtual-playbill.herokuapp.com/).

Using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) to track my [learning goals](http://learninggrid.meteor.com/) is easy! As I go, I can move a javascript MVVM from "Learning Zone" to "Comfort Zone", and manage my future projects along the way.

<h2><a href="http://github.com/keighty/eh-"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Eh?</h2>
[Eh?](http://www.katieleonard.ca/eh-/index.html) is a programming language I am building using idiomatic Canadianisms. I am gaining a greater understanding of how languages function, and love considering what features are useful/essential in a language.

```
a Canadian
with toque
with scarf
with broom

can curl
    if skip
      say "Hurry!"
    elsif lead
      say "That's too much ice..."
    eh?
  eh?
eh?
```
