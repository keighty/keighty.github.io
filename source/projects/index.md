<h2><a href="https://github.com/keighty/virtual_playbill"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Virtual Playbill</h2>
Since moving to Portland, my partner and I have been seeing more theater than we can keep track of, so I built a [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) application to help us [track our collection](http://virtualplaybill.meteor.com/) of ticket stubs.

<h2><a href="http://github.com/keighty/learningGrid"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Learning Grid</h2>
Using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) to track my [learning goals](http://learninggrid.meteor.com/) is easy! As I go, I can move a javascript MVVM from "Learning Zone" to "Comfort Zone", and manage my future projects along the way.

<h2><a href="http://github.com/keighty/eh-"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Eh?</h2>
[Eh?](http://www.katieleonard.ca/eh-/index.html) is a programming language I am building using idiomatic Canadianisms. I am gaining a greater understanding of how languages function, and love considering what features I want in a language.

```
a Canadian
with toque
with scarf
with broom

can curl
    if skip
      say "Hurry!"
    elsif lead
      say "That's too much ice..."
    eh?
  eh?
eh?
```

<h2><a href="http://github.com/keighty/JSGames"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> JSGames</h2>
I wrote [JSGames](http://js-games.herokuapp.com/) to practice different web technologies, including jQuery, Bootstrap, Sinatra, Rspec, Jasmine, ActiveRecord, and PostgreSQL.

* [Solitaire](http://js-games.herokuapp.com/solitaire): Similar to peg solitaire, the object of the game is to turn all the squares blue.
* [Mastermind](http://js-games.herokuapp.com/mastermind): Like the board game, Mastermind is a single-player code-breaking game.
* [Animal Quiz](http://js-games.herokuapp.com/animalquiz): An artificial intelligence game for teaching a database to guess the animal you are thinking of.

<h2><a href="http://github.com/keighty/PCSnotes/tree/gh-pages"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Code Samples</h2>
I used [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) to generate annotated documentation for some useful pieces of code.

* [Benchmark.rb](http://www.katieleonard.ca/PCSnotes/docs/benchmark.html)
* [Animal Quiz.rb](http://www.katieleonard.ca/PCSnotes/docs/animal_quiz.html)

##Android Applications
[KApplications](http://kapplications.ca/) is a side project for building personal productivity Android applications.
