[A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C34HUS/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001C34HUS&linkCode=as2&tag=bridgeforpoke-20) by James Webb Young (1965)

Young proposes that all ideas are the result of five identifiable stages of rumination, whether they are followed consciously or not:

1. Gather information, and not just what is specific to your problem domain. Novelty comes from mashing seemingly unrelated concepts together.
2. Review the information -- collate your information in some fashion and go over it. A lot.
3. Do something else. Get distracted from whatever problem you are trying to solve.
4. "Eureka! I have it!"
5. Refine your idea -- first drafts are never perfect, so keep polishing.
