Information visualization (insight, understanding, and discovery) and information art (aesthetics) differ in their context, audience, and goals. In my exploration of D3 I came across an [Information Visualization Manifesto](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/blog/?p=644) by Manuel Lima, and this is what I have learned<!--more-->:

* **Form follows function**: keep your problem domain in mind when assembling a visualization.
* **Question**: Drive your work through questions and curiosity.
* **Interactivity** is key.
* **Sources**: Provide access to the raw data if possible.
* **Narrative**: Tell a story with your data.
* **Aesthetics** Are a consequence of visualization, not a goal.
* **Relevancy**: What is the context? What patterns are discernable?
* **Time**: Consider time when your data is affected by it.
* **Knowledge**: Bring new understanding and insight.
* **Ease up**: Not everything can or should be visualized. Be deliberate and add to information, don't obfuscate with unnecessary visualizations.
