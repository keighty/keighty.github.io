[The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AYQNR5U/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AYQNR5U&linkCode=as2&tag=bridgeforpoke-20) (Pragmatic Life), by Chad Fowler
(affiliate link)

This book is aptly titled, and an awesome read. It consists of a series of tips -- strategies Fowler has employed to build his own remarkable career. The most important tip is one that can't really be crossed off a list, and that is to build a successful career in software development one must be passionate about software development.

##Update:
Unbeknownst to me when I was finishing this book, but knownst to me now is that there has been a vibrant conversation occurring on the interweb about passion and programming. Check out Avdi Grimm's latest, [The Passion Gospel](http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/02/10/the-passion-gospel/).
