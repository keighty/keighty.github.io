Many people would like a do-over of 2016, but this was a pretty epic year for me. I was traveling pretty constantly, reading voraciously, and enjoying each left-turn my career has taken me. I started the year helping to build instrumentation for single-page applications, bounced into some UI projects using React, and spent the last quarter ensconced in a crash-course in Java Concurrency. <!--more -->Other highlights include achieving US Residency (so long for now, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦  ), seeing a more reasonable amount of theater, and shipping more diverse side-project code than ever.
