###[Scientists Begin Looking at Programmers' Brains: The Neuroscience of Programming](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-parnin/scientists-begin-looking-_b_4829981.html) from The Huffington Post.

> A new study provides new evidence that programmers are using language regions of the brain when understanding code and found little activation in other regions of the brain devoted to mathematical thinking.

* Each programming language you learn requires expressing abstract concepts with a different syntax -- and in the case of punctuation (~>, =>, :, {}, [], etc) an augmented alphabet. How is a programming language NOT like linguistics?

> Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer. --Djikstra
